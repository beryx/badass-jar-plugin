== Badass Jar Plugin

This plugin lets you seamlessly create modular jars that target a Java release before 9.
This way, your library can be used not only by people who build JPMS applications, but also by people who are still using Java 8 or older releases.


=== Prerequisites
The plugin requires Gradle 7.1 or newer. For older Gradle releases you can use https://github.com/beryx/badass-jar-plugin/tree/version-1.x[version 1.2.0] of this plugin.

Note that your build can create a modular jar even when using a Java 7 or 8 toolchain.
This is possible because in this case the plugin assembles the module descriptors without using the java compiler.


=== Usage

To use the plugin, include the following in your build script:
[source,groovy]
----
plugins {
    id 'java'
    id 'org.beryx.jar' version '2.0.0'
}
----

The plugin uses an extension named `moduleConfig`. The sample below shows a few configuration options.
[source,groovy]
----
moduleConfig {
    moduleInfoPath = 'src/main/module/module-info.java'
    multiReleaseVersion = 9
    version = project.version
}
----

Since all properties have default values, the `moduleConfig` block may be missing.

To make your library modular, you need to provide a `module-info.java`, which usually resides in the project's main java source directory.
If the version of your java toolchain is greater than 8, the plugin compiles this file using the java compiler.
Otherwise, it uses the https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser[JavaParser] to analyze the `module-info.java` file and the https://asm.ow2.io/[ASM] bytecode manipulation framework to generate the corresponding module descriptor.
Note that in this later case, the plugin cannot validate your module descriptor.
References to nonexistent packages, modules, services, or service implementations go undetected.

Therefore, you should use a Java 9+ toolchain whenever it's possible.

The properties provided by the `moduleConfig` extension are described below.

==== _multiReleaseVersion_: create a Multi-release JAR with a specific version
[purple]##default value: ## `-1` (the module-info.class is put in the root of the jar)

Typically, a https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/spec/sotms/#module-artifacts[modular jar]
includes the `module-info.class` file in its root directory.
This may cause problems with some older tools, which incorrectly process the module descriptor as if it were a normal Java class.
To avoid this, you can create a
https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/238#Modular-multi-release-JAR-files[modular multi-release jar]
with the `module-info.class` file located in `META-INF/versions/<number>`, as shown below.

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beryx/badass-jar-plugin/master/doc/multi-release-jar.png[multi-release-jar,548,200]

By setting the `multiReleaseVersion` property to a value greater than 0, the plugin will create a multi-release jar:

[source,groovy]
----
moduleConfig {
    multiReleaseVersion = 9
    ...
}
----

==== _moduleInfoPath_: configure module-info.java location
[purple]##default value: ## `src/main/java/module-info.java`

As mentioned before, this plugin lets you create a modular jar even if you use a Java 7 or 8 toolchain.
However, your IDE may complain  about the presence of `module-info.java` in your source directory when using a pre-Java 9 compiler.
To avoid this situation, you can tell the plugin to retrieve the module descriptor from another location.
You do this by setting the `moduleInfoPath` property in the `moduleConfig` extension:

[source,groovy]
----
moduleConfig {
    moduleInfoPath = 'src/main/module/module-info.java'
    ...
}
----

You should avoid using property when using a java toolchain with a version >= 9.

==== _version_: configure module version
[purple]##default value: ## _empty_ (no module version will be set)

You can specify a version for your module by setting the `version` property in the `moduleConfig` extension:

[source,groovy]
----
moduleConfig {
    version = '2.3.4'
    ...
}
----

==== _neverCompileModuleInfo_: always use JavaParser and ASM to assemble the module descriptor
[purple]##default value: ## `false`

By default, if the version of your java toolchain is greater than 8, the plugin uses the java compiler to assemble a module descriptor from the `module-info.java` file.
In some cases this may fail because the plugin is not able to determine all the compiler and jvm settings required for a JPMS build.
A typical example is a project that uses Kotlin. In this case, you can set `neverCompileModuleInfo` to `true` in order to instruct the plugin to create the module descriptor using the JavaParser and the ASM library instead of the compiler.

[source,groovy]
----
moduleConfig {
    neverCompileModuleInfo = true
    ...
}
----

=== Examples

The following projects illustrate how to use this plugin to create modular jars targeted to pre-Java 9 releases:

- https://github.com/beryx-gist/badass-jar-example-nqueens[badass-jar-example-nqueens]: a Java library for solving the N-Queens problem.
- https://github.com/beryx-gist/badass-jar-example-nqueens-kotlin[badass-jar-example-nqueens-kotlin]: a Kotlin library for solving the N-Queens problem.

=== Alternatives

Instead of this plugin you can use the https://github.com/java9-modularity/gradle-modules-plugin[gradle-modules-plugin] with the
https://github.com/java9-modularity/gradle-modules-plugin#separate-compilation-of-module-infojava[modularity.mixedJavaRelease] option.
Choose the solution that best suits your needs.
